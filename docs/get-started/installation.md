# Get Started

To get started, install the package into your Python environment using pip:

```
pip install qt-material-ui
```

You will then need to provide your own Qt installation, since this library is using [qtpy](https://pypi.org/project/QtPy/) to work with multiple versions of Qt. If you don't already have Qt installed, you can install PySide6 with pip as well:

```
pip install PySide6
```
